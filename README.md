# Generating Custom Yelp Reviews
This project is my attempt at reproducing some of the work from an amazing recent research paper submitted August 27, 2017 by a team of reserachers from UC Santa Barbara and the University of Chicago:
["Automated Crowdturfing Attacks and Defenses in Online Review Systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08151)

## What are the quick details of this paper?
In this paper the authors discuss the business of creating "fake" reviews that is prominent on Amazon, Yelp, etc.  The researchers showed that they could use Deep Learning to create human quality restaurant reviews (both in terms of looking realistic as well as being rated as helpful), customize them, beat a standard baseline of fake review detection using regular Machine Learning methods, but also create a Recurrent Neural Network that could in fact detect these computer generated reviews with high accuracy. 

## What did I do, and why?
