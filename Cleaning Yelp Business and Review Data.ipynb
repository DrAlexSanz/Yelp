I did not know it just closed, that seems like really poor timing with the new movie coming out this summer.   \\n\\nThe Star Trek Experience itself was awesome.  Nothing like standing on the bridge of Enterprise NCC-1701D itself.  Our favorite part was the shuttle craft ride, and I don\\'t ever remember anything that realistic.   It was so scary to get sucked out of the shuttle craft bay door that it was hard not to yell.  We rode that three times in a row.  \\n\\nWhen eating in Quark\\'s Bar a Klingon woman came up to me and got all in my face saying \"You look like you\\'ve never seen a Klingon woman before!\"   My brother started busting up laughing and I was quite intimidated as she would not break her gaze and just kept staring at me.  I\\'ve never thought of Klingons again in the same way.   Our Dad asked her if she looks like that when she goes by the gas station on the way home.   Hehe.   Without missing a beat she yelled \"Klingons have no use for fossil fuels!\"  And at that point none of us knew what to say..   Haha.  \\n\\nWhen walking to the bar a Ferengi looked up at us and said \"Some humans are very tall\".   (Our whole family is over 6 feet tall).      Totally excellent place with creative food and it really feels like (felt like) you were in Star Trek itself.   One of the most amazing things I have ever seen.'\n",

       "4  <SOR>I really like their bread.  Always soft inside and not too thick or hard on the outside.I like their fresh cut deli meats, but my favorite is always the TUNA, which is never soggy with mayo.  They do limit their toppings, but with great meat and bread all those toppings the competitors offer are not required.  They're always friendly and quick and the owner/manager is always there making sandwiches too.Why buy a $10 sandwich at WholeFoods when you can get a better one at Blimpie's?<EOR>"
